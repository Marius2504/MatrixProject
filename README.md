### Backstory: 
I have chosen to develop Snake game because I found it really cool and fun to do.
### Game description: 
the game presents a snake which can move in all 4 directions using a joystick. The snake doesn't stop and it will continue moving towards the direction you have chosen before. If the snake catch an apple, its length will increase depending on the difficulty level(easy,medium,hard,impossible). If the snake bits himself, it is game over.
### Instructions: 
To move, you need to use the joystick. If the snake hits the wall, he will return on the parralel wall. To catch an apple, you need to walk over it.
### Used Components: 
LCD, joystick, buzzer and the ledmatrix.
